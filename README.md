If you can remember me talking about "the Miracle of Compound Interest" well investing is like that with multipliers. And occasional pitfalls called Bear Markets, which we're in now. If you didn't know what to invest in before, don't worry, it's like the stock market said "Unsure? Let me take 25% off everything. So what would you like?" We would like, to start with, a retirement account full of money.


4ish Steps To Retirement Wealth 
-------------------------------
1. Create a Roth IRA account at an online brokerage firm (some banks as well)
2. Add money to it from your checking account
3. Buy an S&P 500 Index-Tracking ETF (or Mutual Fund) as a base
4. Branch out into areas you think will out-perform the S&P 500
5. Repeat Steps 2, 3, 4 until you reach the max annual contribution allowed each year
   * Until *JULY* 15th, 2020 you may contribute to the 2019 calendar year against the 2019 max

The Details
-----------

1. Pick an online brokerage and create a **Roth IRA account**. Brokerages are all pretty much the same and offer the same basic services -- they just look different in the same way checking accounts at different online banks are pretty much the same with different looking web sites. Try a few and pick a site that seems intuitive to you, or see if your current online bank has an investing option. I use [Ally Bank](https://www.ally.com "I've used Ally for years"), [eTrade](https://www.etrade.com "Back in the day I used to day trade on this site"), and [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/go/join-fidelity-investments-now) to keep my Retirement and Personal Investing goals completely separate.
   * *Make sure the brokerage account you select offers FREE stock trading ~ they pretty much all do now, just make sure*

2. Fund your account. You can start with as much or little as you like. Stocks/ETFs/Mutual Funds will be in the $50-300+ range per share so you may have to let cash accumulate in the account to buy full shares of stocks/ETFs at times. An advantage of mutual funds is that you may buy them in dollar amounts and fractional shares, so you can invest say a flat $50 if you want, whereas with stocks/ETFs you have to buy full shares at its given price. You can even set up automatic investing so $x gets transferred from your account every whatever-timeframe-you-specify, usually monthly or bi-weekly to match payday, whatever.

3. Buy with a Limit Order. Say the price of what you want to buy is bouncing between 88-89. You think it'll go lower so you set a **buy limit order** with a price of $86.50 *and walk away*. If the price of the stock/ETF drops to your limit order price, it'll be purchased. If not, it won't. But you'll only buy it at the pre-set price you rationally decided you were comfortable with ahead of time. So set a price and leave it...walk away. Don't get caught up watching the stock market chart and if the price starts going up change your order to a Market Buy (whatever price it is when the order hits). Don't chase after prices. **Set it and forget it**. If you get caught up in the moment you'll lose money. You can't time the market.

   * Kids, right now, ALL prices are cheap. Your investment timeline is FOREVER. Remember the Miracle of Compound Interest. Don't chase prices, just buy

4. Every year the Gov sets a max on how much you can put in a Roth IRA that calendar year, currently

| Age            | 2019   | 2020   |
| -------------- |:------:|:------:| 
| 49 and younger | $6,000 | $6,000 |
| 50 and older   | $7,000 | $7,000 |

  * But you have until April 15th to contribute to the prior year if you haven't met your max

Why a Roth IRA?
---------------
Roth IRAs are contributed to with after-tax dollars (remember the income tax withheld when you got paid?). So the main benefit of this over a traditional pre-tax dollars 401k plan is:
   * At age 59.5 you can start to withdraw as much as you wish whenever **completely tax free**. Years and years of stock market gains to just spend and never pay the gov a nickel on the earnings.
   * Before then, there's a tax penalty, and you lose momentum riding the Miracle of Compound Interest *with Multipliers*, so don't. Just don't.

What else?
----------
Investing and Retirement are huge topics; I just wanted to put up the basics to get started and this document can be built upon.

DRIP
----
**D**ividend **R**e**I**nvestment **P**lan -- some stocks pay a dividend (sort of like variable interest at a bank savings account), you can either have that payment go to your investment account's "cash" area or simply re-invested into whatever stock it is -- and I usually opt for that. If you are happy enough to own the stock/fund, why not have the little bonuses just buy more of the same? The Miracle of Compound Interest at work!

If you just want to instant-invest super easy just to get started, you can do so on your phone's version of __*Cash App*__ for as little as $1

Lastly
------
Yes, you can have both a Roth IRA and a 401k IRA, and if your employer has a 401k plan and matches your contributions to it then **definitely take advantage of that** at least up to the percentage of your income that they will match in contributions. Double the investment seed money for free!
